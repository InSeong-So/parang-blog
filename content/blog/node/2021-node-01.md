## Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
```
The error "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent." means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written. For example, look for callbacks that are accidentally called twice, or any error that happens after the body is sent.
```
```js
throw new ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT('set');
```
